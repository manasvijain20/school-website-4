                increasingly difficult for someone to function without a
                knowledge of computers. At Podar International School, we
                realize this and have a state-of-the-art computer lab in the
                school premises. The computer lab is air-conditioned with
                the adequate number of latest PCs which have all the
                required software installed. All PCs have a high-speed
                internet connection. The lab is specially designed to
                educate the students with the latest technology so that the
                children get comfortable with technology at a very young
                age.</p>

                sports for all age groups so that children can relax and
                exercise at the same time with a sporting spirit. The school
                has appointed a trained Physical Training Master to train
                the children in various indoor games like chess and carrom
                and outdoor games like football, volleyball, basketball etc.
                We encourage students to participate in all sports events.</p>

                        According to Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of survival of the fittest, it is not the smartest or the most intelligent species that survive but the fastest to change and adapt. With the outbreak of the pandemic of Covid-19 the world was faced with a situation where only those who adapted survived.
                        <br>
                        Podar Education Network was quick at adapting to the situation. In the short transition period from pre-lockdown to lockdown the Podar Innovation Centre created a Virtual School Plan (VSP) that went live on the 2nd of April, 2020 - the scheduled day for the start of the new academic session.
                        <br>
                        The Virtual School Plan (VSP) was a threefold plan with creation of content to support synchronous and asynchronous virtual classroom teaching in the form of resources like lesson plans and student support documents amongst others, creation of a support system to guide teachers, students and parents alike, to transition smoothly onto a platform for teaching that many of them had never experienced before; and thirdly the creation of a system to continuously monitor and evaluate the performance of schools - despite the odds.
                        <br>
                        All verticals of the Podar Innovation Centre worked in synergy to create and execute the plan effectively
